[ultravioleta](https://montoyamoraga.io/ultravioleta/index.html) is a creative machine learning exploration by [Nicole L'Huillier](https://nicolelhuillier.com/) and [Aarón Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/), created between October 2020 - December 2020, on the context of the class Arts@ML by professor [Tod Machover](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tod/overview/), at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).

This project features a [Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/ml5js/training-charRNN), which was trained with a a combination of Chilean multidisciplinary artist [Violeta Parra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violeta_Parra)'s décimas from 1960s, and a compilation of text from graffits in Santiago de Chile during the [2019-2020 protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Chilean_protests), which led to the national referendum to create a new constitution. The algorithm was then used to create synthetic décimas, asa conversation between present and past. You can see a video of us demoing the project [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montoyamoraga/ultraVioleta/main/docs/ultravioleta-prototype.mp4), where we are reading the décimas out loud, accompained by nylon string guitar samples from Violeta Parra's records. A main inspiration for creating this project is to use high-end technology, such as machine learning, for creative non-commercial purposes, such as the creation of poetry, and more so, to increase representation of Spanish speaking communities and of Latin American artists.

The project was programmed using open source projects [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and in this repository you can find all the history of the different versions and commits that were created during this project.
