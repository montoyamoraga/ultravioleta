# ultravioleta

ultravioleta is a creative machine learning project by [Nicole L'Huillier](https://nicolelhuillier.com/) and [Aarón Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/), between October 2020 - December 2020, on the context of the class Arts@ML by professor [Tod Machover](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/tod/overview/), at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). We trained a [Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/ml5js/training-charRNN) on a combination of [Violeta Parra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violeta_Parra)'s décimas from 1960s, and a compilation of graffits from Santiago de Chile during the [2019-2020 protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Chilean_protests). We used this algorithm to create synthetic décimas, and in the [documentation video](docs/ultravioleta-prototype.mp4) we are reading them out loud, accompained by nylon string guitar samples from Violeta Parra's records. The project was programmed using open source projects [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
